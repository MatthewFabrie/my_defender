# my_defender
the goal of this project was to make a tower defense game with the help of the CSFML library. It was our third graphical project and the goal was to defend our base from enemy attackers. you can destroy the enemies by placing defense towers that will slowly damage them and eventually kill them. If the enemies reach your castle you will slowly start to lose health until you have none left and you lose. In order to win the game you have to survive 5 waves of enemies and if you don't survive you lose. To launch the game you must first clone the repository, then you must execute the "make" command in a terminal and you can then launch the game by entering the ./my_defender command at the root of the project. This project was carried out with Matth√©o Selingant (https://github.com/Fusyony)
